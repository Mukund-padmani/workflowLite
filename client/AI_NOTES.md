# AI Implementation Report

**Project:** Workflow Builder Lite
---

## 1. AI Usage in Development
This entire application was architected and generated by an advanced AI agent.

### **What AI Did:**
*   **Architecture Design:** Conceived the split between React Frontend and Express Backend for scalability.
*   **Code Generation:** Wrote 100% of the initial code for:
    *   **Frontend Components:** `Builder`, `History`, `Status` pages using modern React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`).
    *   **Backend Logic:** Created the `server/index.js` API handling and file-based "database" logic.
*   **UI/UX Design:** Generated the CSS variables for the dark mode/glassmorphism theme without external libraries like Tailwind.
*   **Integration:** Implemented **Hugging Face Inference API** to connect the app to real LLMs.

### **Verification (Human/User Check):**
*   **Input Validation:** Verified that sending empty text triggers a 400 Error.
*   **Data Persistence:** Verified that `history.json` correctly saves and retrieves the last 5 runs.
*   **Real AI Connection:** Confirmed Llama 3.1 8B is processing requests via the server logs.

## 2. LLM Provider & Architecture

### **Application's Intelligence Engine (Hybrid)**
The running application now uses a **Smart Hybrid Engine**:

#### **1. Primary Engine: Meta Llama 3.1 8B Instruct**
*   **Provider:** Hugging Face Inference API
*   **Model:** `meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct`
*   **Role:** Handles the core workflow steps (Summarization, Cleaning, Extraction) with state-of-the-art reasoning.
*   **Configuration:** Uses `chatCompletion` API with a strict system prompt to ensure clean, direct output.

#### **2. Fallback Engine: Simulated Logic**
*   **Provider:** Local Node.js Logic
*   **Role:** Acts as a safety net. If the Llama API fails (e.g., rate limits, network issues), the app automatically switches to simulated Regex/Heuristic logic so the user experience is never interrupted.
